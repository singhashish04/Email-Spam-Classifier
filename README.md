# Email Spam Classifier ðŸ“§ðŸš«
An Email Spam Classifier is a machine learning project designed to identify and filter spam emails from legitimate ones. This project leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques and classification algorithms to build a predictive model that accurately detects spam messages.

# Features
-> Dataset Preprocessing: Handles text cleaning, tokenization, and feature extraction (e.g., using TF-IDF or Count Vectorizer).
-> Machine Learning Models: Implements algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classification.
-> Evaluation Metrics: Analyzes model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
-> Interactive Interface: (Optional) Provides a simple UI or CLI to input email text and classify it as spam or not spam.

# Technology Stack
-> Programming Language: Python
-> Libraries: pandas and numpy for data manipulation
-> scikit-learn for machine learning models and evaluation
-> nltk for natural language processing
-> Streamlit for a web-based or GUI interface
